/**
 * Indexing mode switch — preview/staging detection is automatic.
 *
 * Two independent triggers, so a staging host can never become indexable:
 *
 * 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXING_MODE=preview — explicit opt-in used by the local
 *    dev daemon (.env.preview) on the temporary ChatZ preview environment.
 *
 * 2. VERCEL_ENV — Vercel injects this on every deployment: "production" for
 *    production, "preview" for branch/PR deployments, "development" for
 *    `vercel dev`. Any Vercel deployment that is not production is staging.
 *    This requires zero Vercel dashboard configuration and production
 *    deployments keep full index,follow directives (they cannot inherit
 *    noindex because their VERCEL_ENV is exactly "production").
 *
 * When IS_PREVIEW is true: every page emits `noindex, nofollow`, robots.txt
 * disallows all crawlers, the sitemap route returns an empty document, and
 * next.config adds an X-Robots-Tag header on every response — the temporary
 * preview domain must never become indexable and must not publish production
 * SEO signals.
 *
 * Production (vars unset, or VERCEL_ENV=production) → indexable config.
