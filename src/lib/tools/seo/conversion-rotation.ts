    "You nudge the angle while watching a live preview; the tool rotates and, when zoom-fill is on, scales the image just enough that no empty corners show — the classic straighten-without-cropping-look. Small angles cost almost no quality because the resample is gentle.",
    "Drop one image, drag the angle slider in tenths of a degree until the horizon sits level in the preview, keep zoom-fill enabled for a full-bleed result, then process and download.",
    "Accepts .jpg, .png and .webp up to 30MB; single-image editing. Beyond about 5°, zoom-fill starts cropping noticeably into the frame — for bigger corrections, crop afterward or shoot straighter next time (easier said than done).",
    "The most common photo fix there is: sea horizons, architectural lines, scanned documents scanned slightly askew, and table-top product shots. One slider beats opening a heavyweight editor for a two-degree correction."
