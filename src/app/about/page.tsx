        <p>
          PixKitApp is a collection of <strong className="text-foreground">{TOOLS.length} free image tools</strong> built on a simple
          belief: you shouldn&apos;t have to upload your photos to a stranger&apos;s server just to resize, compress, or convert them.
          Every tool on this site runs entirely inside your browser using the HTML5 Canvas API, the browser's built-in image codecs, and
          modern JavaScript — your images never touch our infrastructure, because there is no upload infrastructure at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project started when we noticed how most &quot;free online image tools&quot; work: you hand over your photos, wait for a
          round trip to a datacenter, and hope the file gets deleted. Family photos, ID documents, business assets — all transmitted
          for a task a modern browser can do instantly. We built PixKitApp to prove that model is obsolete. Processing happens at
          your device&apos;s full speed with no upload round-trip, and keeps confidential material (passports, contracts, medical
          scans) exactly where it belongs: with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The toolkit spans {TOOLS.length} genuinely different tools across 14 categories — compression with exact target sizes,
          pixel-precise resizing, an interactive crop editor, format conversion including PDF and ICO, watermarking, filters,
          EXIF inspection and stripping, color analysis, transparency work, social-media presets and passport photo guides with
          official dimensions. Each tool is purpose-built rather than a re-skin, and each works on phones, tablets, Chromebooks
          and desktops.

          PixKitApp is built with Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and is designed to deploy to edge platforms like Vercel
          where the whole site is served as static files. The processing engines — from the median-cut color quantizer to the
          multi-page PDF writer — are hand-built TypeScript that runs in your browser process. You can verify the no-upload claim
          with your browser&apos;s network inspector: load a tool, process an image, and watch zero outbound requests carry your data.
